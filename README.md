# Neuroparticles

![Preview](images/11x11.gif)

**Neuroparticles** is an artificial life simulation where neural network-driven particles battle for survival on a grid, evolving through genetic algorithms. Born in 2019, this project explores emergent behaviors in two flavors: a single-population system (`11x11.js`) and a three-population predator-prey dynamic (`rgb.js`). Watch particles learn to navigate, compete, and evolve in real-time on a canvas, creating mesmerizing patterns of survival and strategy.

## Features

- **Neural Networks**: Each particle uses a neural network to decide movements based on its surroundings (11x11 grid).
  - **Single Population (`11x11.js`)**: 2000 particles optimize spacing to gain health from neighbors while avoiding overcrowding.
  - **Three Populations (`rgb.js`)**: 600 particles (200 each of Red, Green, Blue) engage in a rock-paper-scissors dynamic (Red eats Green, Green eats Blue, Blue eats Red).
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Particles evolve through crossover and mutation, with fitness based on lifetime or interaction success.
- **Toroidal Grid**: 200x200 grid with wrap-around edges for continuous movement.

## How It Works

- **Grid**: A 200x200 toroidal grid, visualized as 3x3 pixel cells (600x600 canvas).
- **Particles**:
  - **Health Points (HP)**: Start at 10,000 (`11x11.js`) or 1,000 (`rgb.js`). Decay over time, with bonuses/penalties based on neighbors or predator-prey interactions.
  - **Movement**: Neural network outputs choose from 9 moves (8 directions + stay). In `11x11.js`, a `stayBias` of 100 favors staying put.
- **Evolution**: Dead particles (HP â‰¤ 0) are removed. New particles are created via crossover of top survivors, with random mutations to neural network weights.
- **Neural Network**:
  - **Input**: 121 nodes (`11x11.js`, single population) or 363 nodes (`rgb.js`, three populations) from an 11x11 grid around each particle.
  - **Hidden Layer**: 25 nodes with sigmoid activation.
  - **Output**: 9 nodes for movement decisions.
