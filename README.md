# Neuroparticles

![Preview](images/11x11.gif)

Each teeny-weeny dot is a lil organism. It sees (using a neural network) what's around it and moves depending on what it sees. If it survives long enough ‚Äî it produces offspring. If not ‚Äî bb lil dot, you were brave, but other dots were more brave.

**Neuroparticles** is a real-time artificial life simulation based on:

- **Neural Networks** ‚Äî Each agent uses a fully connected feedforward network:
  - **Input Layer**:
    - `11x11.js`: 121 inputs from a single-channel 11√ó11 window.
    - `rgb.js`: 363 inputs from three 11√ó11 channels (Red, Green, Blue).
  - **Hidden Layer**: 25 neurons with sigmoid activation.
  - **Output Layer**: 9 outputs corresponding to 8 movement directions + stay.
  - **Bias terms** are included in the hidden layer.

- **Genetic Algorithm**:
  - The **genome** is a flat array of all network weights and biases.
  - **Fitness** is measured by lifetime (survival time).
  - **Crossover**: uniform crossover between random survivors.
  - **Mutation**: replaces random weights with new random values.

- **Toroidal Grid**: 200√ó200 field with wraparound edges (toroidal topology).
- **Local Perception**: Each agent only sees a limited 11√ó11 area centered on itself.
- **Self-organization**: No global rules. All behavior emerges from local sensing and reproduction pressure.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demos

- [11x11 Mode](https://xcont.com/neuroparticles/11x11.html) ‚Äî One population learning spacing behavior.
- [RGB Mode](https://xcont.com/neuroparticles/rgb.html) ‚Äî Three populations (Red, Green, Blue) in a predator-prey cycle.

## Mode Overview

### `11x11.js`
- **Particles**: 2,000
- **Input**: Single-channel local density
- **Behavior**: Learn to avoid crowding and maximize HP by spacing out
- **Bias**: Small stay-in-place reward (`stayBias = 100`)

### `rgb.js`
- **Particles**: 600 total (200 Red, 200 Green, 200 Blue)
- **Input**: 3-channel input from Red, Green, and Blue fields
- **Dynamic**:
  - Red gains HP from Green, loses from Blue
  - Green gains from Blue, loses from Red
  - Blue gains from Red, loses from Green
- **Behavior**: Evolving predator-prey arms race

## üß† Neural Network Architecture

- **Input size**: `121` or `363`
- **Hidden layer**: 25 sigmoid neurons
- **Output size**: 9 (8 directions + stay)
- **Activation**: `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))`
- **Decision**: Max output determines movement

## ‚öôÔ∏è Evolution Parameters

- **Genotype**: Raw neural weights + biases
- **Crossover**: Uniform (per-gene random split)
- **Mutation**: Random value replacement in `[-2, 2]`
- **Selection**: Based on lifetime (survival time)
- **Reproduction**: Best survivors create 2 children each generation
